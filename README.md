# GPS and IoT Data Upload with ThingerESP32

This Arduino sketch enables you to read GPS data using the TinyGPSPlus library and upload the GPS coordinates, altitude, and speed to the Thinger.io platform using ThingerESP32 library.

## Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE installed
- ThingerESP32 library installed
- TinyGPSPlus library installed
- Access to a Thinger.io account (sign up at https://thinger.io)
- WiFi SSID and password
- Thinger.io account credentials (username, device ID, device credential)

## Setup

1. Open the Arduino IDE and ensure you have all the required libraries installed.
2. Update the following lines in the code with your WiFi credentials and Thinger.io account details:
   ```cpp
   #define SSID "your_wifi_ssid"
   #define SSID_PASSWORD "your_wifi_password"
   #define USERNAME "your_thinger_username"
   #define DEVICE_ID "your_device_id"
   #define DEVICE_CREDENTIAL "your_device_credential"
Connect your ESP32 board to your computer and select the appropriate board and COM port in the Arduino IDE.
Upload the sketch to your ESP32 board.
Usage
The sketch reads GPS data from the connected GPS module using the TinyGPSPlus library.
It connects to your WiFi network and Thinger.io IoT platform to upload GPS location, altitude, and speed data.
The uploaded data can be visualized and analyzed on the Thinger.io dashboard.
Circuit Diagram
Add a simple circuit diagram here if you're connecting any specific components to your ESP32, like a GPS module.

Important Notes
Make sure you keep your sensitive data (WiFi credentials, Thinger.io credentials) private by not sharing them in your code when sharing it online.
Customize the sketch as needed for your project requirements.
